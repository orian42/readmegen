## Installation
  

No installation steps are necessary once the website is visited.
  

## Usage
  

Anyone with the link (https://orian42.github.io/weather/) can use this application.  The application can be used simply by entering a city in the search input box then clicking the search button.  The weather data will be displayed to the screen.  A history button labeled with the most recent search's city will be created and placed below the search button.  A user can simply click that new button to see that city's weather.  Note that if the user manually searches for a city that already has a button displayed, a new button for that city WIL NOT be created to avoid duplicate buttons.  Furthermore, a limit of eight (8) buttons has been set.  If eight buttons already exist and a new city is searched, the last button is deleted when the new button is added.  All history buttons and search history can be cleared by clicking the Clear History button.
